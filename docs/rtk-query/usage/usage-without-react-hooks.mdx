# Usage Without React Hooks

Redux core 및 Redux Toolkit과 마찬가지로 RTK Query의 기능은 UI에 구애받지 않으며 모든 UI 계층에서 사용할 수 있습니다. RTK Query also includes a version of [`createApi`](../api/createApi.mdx) designed specifically for use with React, which [automatically generates React hooks](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx).

While React hooks are the primary way that the majority of users are expected to be using RTK Query, the library itself uses plain JS logic and can be used both with React Class components, and independent of React itself.

This page documents how to interact with RTK Query when used without React Hooks, in order to make proper use of RTK Query [`cache behavior`](./cache-behavior).

## Adding a subscription

캐시 구독은 엔드포인트에 대한 데이터를 가져와야 한다고 RTK Query에 알리는 데 사용됩니다. A subscription for an endpoint can be added by dispatching the result of the [`initiate`](../api/created-api/endpoints.mdx#initiate) thunk action creator attached to a query endpoint.

With React hooks, this behavior is instead handled within [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery), [`useQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequerysubscription), [`useLazyQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquery), and [`useLazyQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquerysubscription).

```ts title="Subscribing to cached data" no-transpile
dispatch(api.endpoints.getPosts.initiate())
```

## Removing a subscription

RTK Query가 캐시된 데이터가 더 이상 필요하지 않음을 식별하려면 캐시 구독을 제거해야 합니다. 이를 통해 RTK 쿼리는 오래된 캐시 데이터를 정리하고 제거할 수 있습니다.

The result of dispatching the [`initiate`](../api/created-api/endpoints.mdx#initiate) thunk action creator of a query endpoint is an object with an `unsubscribe` property. This property is a function that when called, will remove the corresponding cache subscription.

With React hooks, this behavior is instead handled within [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery), [`useQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequerysubscription), [`useLazyQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquery), and [`useLazyQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquerysubscription).

```ts title="Unsubscribing from cached data" no-transpile
// Adding a cache subscription
const result = dispatch(api.endpoints.getPosts.initiate())

// Removing the corresponding cache subscription
result.unsubscribe()
```

## Accessing cached data & request status

Accessing cache data and request status information can be performed using the `select` function property of a query endpoint to create a selector and call that with the Redux state. This provides a snapshot of the cache data and request status information at the time it is called.

:::caution

The `endpoint.select()` function creates a _new_ selector instance - it isn't the actual selector function itself!

:::

With React hooks, this behaviour is instead handled within [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery), [`useQueryState`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequerystate), and [`useLazyQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquery).

```ts title="Accessing cached data & request status" no-transpile
const result = api.endpoints.getPosts.select()(state)
const { data, status, error } = result
```

Note that unlike the auto-generated query hooks, derived booleans such as `isLoading`, `isFetching`, `isSuccess` are not available here. The raw `status` enum is provided instead.

## Performing mutations

[Mutations](./mutations.mdx) are used in order to update data on the server. Mutations can be performed by dispatching the result of the [`initiate`](../api/created-api/endpoints.mdx#initiate) thunk action creator attached to a mutation endpoint.

With React hooks, this behavior is instead handled within [`useMutation`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usemutation).

```ts title="Triggering a mutation endpoint" no-transpile
dispatch(api.endpoints.addPost.initiate({ name: 'foo' }))
```

## Examples

Examples of usage without React hooks can be found under the following:

- The `PostDetail` component in the [`React Class Components` example](./examples.mdx#react-class-components)
- The [`Svelte` example](./examples.mdx#svelte)
- The below `Cache Lifetime Subscription Class Component` example:

## Further Information

- NgRx maintainer Brandon Roberts has written a post called [Cousins playing nicely: Experimenting with NgRx Store and RTK Query](https://dev.to/brandontroberts/cousins-playing-nicely-experimenting-with-ngrx-store-and-rtk-query-25f4), which demonstrates some approaches for integrating RTK Query into NgRx
- [`saulmoro/ngrx-rtk-query`](https://github.com/SaulMoro/ngrx-rtk-query) implements an NgRx equivalent of the subscription lifecycle managed in RTKQ's own React hooks
