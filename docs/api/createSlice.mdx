# `createSlice`

초기 state, reducer 함수의 객체, "slice 이름"을 받아 reducer 및 state에 해당하는 액션 생성자와 액션 유형을 자동으로 생성하는 함수입니다.

이 API는 Redux 로직을 작성하기 위한 표준 접근 방식입니다.

Internally, it uses [`createAction`](./createAction.mdx) and [`createReducer`](./createReducer.mdx), so
you may also use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) to write "mutating" immutable updates:

```ts
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

const initialState = { value: 0 } as CounterState

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value++
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.value--
    },
    incrementByAmount(state, action: PayloadAction<number>) {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions
export default counterSlice.reducer
```

## Parameters

`createSlice`는 다음 옵션과 함께 단일 구성 객체 매개변수를 사용합니다:

```ts no-transpile
function createSlice({
    // A name, used in action types
    name: string,
    // The initial state for the reducer
    initialState: any,
    // An object of "case reducers". Key names will be used to generate actions.
    reducers: Object<string, ReducerFunction | ReducerAndPrepareObject>
    // A "builder callback" function used to add more reducers, or
    // an additional object of "case reducers", where the keys should be other
    // action types
    extraReducers?:
    | Object<string, ReducerFunction>
    | ((builder: ActionReducerMapBuilder<State>) => void)
})
```

### `initialState`

이 slice의 초기 state값입니다.

이것은 호출될 때 초기 state값을 반환해야하는 "lazy initializer" 함수일 수도 있습니다. This will be used whenever the reducer is called with `undefined` as its state value, and is primarily useful for cases like reading initial state from `localStorage`.

### `name`

이 slice of state의 문자열 이름입니다. Generated action type constants will use this as a prefix.

### `reducers`

An object containing Redux "case reducer" functions (functions intended to handle a specific action type, equivalent
to a single case statement in a switch).

The keys in the object will be used to generate string action type constants, and these will show up in the Redux
DevTools Extension when they are dispatched. Also, if any other part of the application happens to dispatch an action
with the exact same type string, the corresponding reducer will be run. Therefore, you should give the functions
descriptive names.

이 객체는 [`createReducer`](./createReducer.mdx)로 전달되므로 감속기는 주어진 state를 안전하게 "mutate"할 수 있습니다.

```ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
  },
})
// Will handle the action type `'counter/increment'`
```

#### Customizing Generated Action Creators

If you need to customize the creation of the payload value of an action creator by means of a [`prepare callback`](./createAction.mdx#using-prepare-callbacks-to-customize-action-contents), the value of the appropriate field of the `reducers` argument object should be an object instead of a function. This object must contain two properties: `reducer` and `prepare`. The value of the `reducer` field should be the case reducer function while the value of the `prepare` field should be the prepare callback function:

```ts
import { createSlice, PayloadAction, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface Item {
  id: string
  text: string
}

const todosSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: [] as Item[],
  reducers: {
    addTodo: {
      reducer: (state, action: PayloadAction<Item>) => {
        state.push(action.payload)
      },
      prepare: (text: string) => {
        const id = nanoid()
        return { payload: { id, text } }
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### `extraReducers`

One of the key concepts of Redux is that each slice reducer "owns" its slice of state, and that many slice reducers
can independently respond to the same action type. `extraReducers` 를 사용하면 `createSlice` 가 생성한 action types 외의 
다른 action types에도 응답할 수 있습니다.

As case reducers specified with `extraReducers` are meant to reference "external" actions, they will not have actions generated in `slice.actions`.

`reducers`와 마찬가지로, 이 case reducers 또한 `createReducer`를 통해 전달되며 state를 안전하게 "mutate" 할 수 있습니다.

If two fields from `reducers` and `extraReducers` happen to end up with the same action type string,
the function from `reducers` will be used to handle that action type.

### The `extraReducers` "builder callback" notation

'extraReducers'를 사용하는 권장 방법은 'ActionReducerMapBuilder' 인스턴스를 수신하는 콜백을 사용하는 것입니다.

This builder notation is also the only way to add matcher reducers and default case reducers to your slice.

[examples](docblock://createSlice.ts?token=CreateSliceOptions.extraReducers)

We recommend using this API as it has better TypeScript support (and thus, IDE autocomplete even for JavaScript users), as it will correctly infer the action type in the reducer based on the provided action creator.
It's particularly useful for working with actions produced by `createAction` and `createAsyncThunk`.

See [the "Builder Callback Notation" section of the `createReducer` reference](./createReducer.mdx#usage-with-the-builder-callback-notation) for details on how to use `builder.addCase`, `builder.addMatcher`, and `builder.addDefault`

### The `extraReducers` "map object" notation

Like `reducers`, `extraReducers` can be an object containing Redux case reducer functions. However, the keys should
be other Redux string action type constants, and `createSlice` will _not_ auto-generate action types or action creators
for reducers included in this parameter.

Action creators that were generated using [`createAction`](./createAction.mdx) may be used directly as the keys here, using
computed property syntax.

```js
const incrementBy = createAction('incrementBy')

createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: {
    [incrementBy]: (state, action) => {
      return state + action.payload
    },
    'some/other/action': (state, action) => {},
  },
})
```

:::tip

우리는 'builder callback' API를 기본적으로 사용하는 것을 권장하며, 특히 Typescript를 사용한다면 더욱 권장합니다. 만약 Typescript를 사용하면서 'builder callback'을 사용하지 않는다면, `actionCreator.type` 나 `actionCreator.toString()` 를 통해 TS compiler가 계산된 property를 받도록 해야합니다. 자세한 내용은 [Usage With TypeScript](./../usage/usage-with-typescript.md#type-safety-with-extraReducers) 를 참조하세요.

## Return Value

`createSlice`는 다음과 같은 객체를 반환합니다:

```ts no-transpile
{
    name : string,
    reducer : ReducerFunction,
    actions : Record<string, ActionCreator>,
    caseReducers: Record<string, CaseReducer>.
    getInitialState: () => State
}
```

Each function defined in the `reducers` argument will have a corresponding action creator generated using [`createAction`](./createAction.mdx)
and included in the result's `actions` field using the same function name.

The generated `reducer` function is suitable for passing to the Redux `combineReducers` function as a "slice reducer".

You may want to consider destructuring the action creators and exporting them individually, for ease of searching
for references in a larger codebase.

> **Note**: the result object is conceptually similar to a
> ["Redux duck" code structure](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure#what-should-my-file-structure-look-like-how-should-i-group-my-action-creators-and-reducers-in-my-project-where-should-my-selectors-go).
> The actual code structure you use is up to you, but there are a couple caveats to keep in mind:
>
> - Actions are not exclusively limited to a single slice. Any part of the reducer logic can (and should!) respond
>   to any dispatched action.
> - At the same time, circular references can cause import problems. If slices A and B are defined in
>   separate files, and each file tries to import the other so it can listen to other actions, unexpected
>   behavior may occur.
